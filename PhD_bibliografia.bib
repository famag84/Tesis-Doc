    isbn = {978-1-4200-7517-5},
    abstract = {Polymer translocation occurs in many biological and biotechnological phenomena where electrically charged polymer molecules move through narrow spaces in crowded environments. Unraveling the rich phenomenology of polymer translocation requires a grasp of modern concepts of polymer physics and polyelectrolyte behavior. Polymer Translocation discusses universal features of polymer translocations and summarizes the key concepts of polyelectrolyte structures, electrolyte solutions, ionic flow, mobility of charged macromolecules, polymer capture by pores, and threading of macromolecules through pores.  With approximately 150 illustrations and 850 equations, the book:   Avoids heavy mathematics Uses examples to illustrate the richness of the phenomenon Introduces the entropic barrier idea behind polymer translocation Outlines conceptual components necessary for a molecular understanding of polymer translocation Provides mathematical formulas for the various quantities pertinent to polymer translocation   The challenge in understanding the complex behavior of translocation of polyelectrolyte molecules arises from three long-range forces due to chain connectivity, electrostatic interactions, and hydrodynamic interactions. Polymer Translocation provides an overview of fundamentals, established experimental facts, and important concepts necessary to understand polymer translocation. Readers will gain detailed strategies for applying these concepts and formulas to the design of new experiments.},

  abstract={Ion transport through nanopores is modelled by the Smoluchowski equation. The model, based on properties of a bulk electrolyte solution and containing no adjustable parameters, is compared with ion current data recorded for single cylindrical nanopores in polymeric films. It predicts qualitatively a possibility of constructing an ion current rectifier based on the symmetric nanopore with asymmetric charge distribution. Our experimental data, however, indicate that the bulk-type diffusion approach does not describe the surface current, which gives a significant contribution to the total ion current through nanopores.}

The foil separates two aqueous potassium chloride solutions having the same composition or different compositions. Two silver/silver chloride electrodes are used to pass an electric current across the pore. In the present study these findings are analysed in terms of the {"}model of the membrane with narrow pores{"}. This analysis leads to a qualitative explanation of the reported transport phenomenon distinctly different from that given by Siwy and Fulinski."

An alternative approach{\textemdash}fabrication of multilayers by consecutive adsorption of polyanions and polycations{\textemdash}is far more general and has been extended to other materials such as proteins or colloids.

The immobilized HRP-enzyme molecules bear sugar (mannose) groups available for the binding of Con A protein. Secondly{,} the bioconjugation of Con A on the pore wall was achieved through its biospecific interactions with the mannose residues of the HRP enzyme. The immobilization of biomolecules inside the nanopore leads to the reduction of the available area for ionic transport{,} and this blocking effect can be exploited to tune the conductance and selectivity of the nanopore in aqueous solution. Both cylindrical and conical nanopores were used in the experiments. The possibility of obtaining two or more conductance states (output){,} dictated by the degree of nanopore blocking resulted from the different biomolecules in solution (input){,} as well as the current rectification properties obtained with the conical nanopore{,} could also allow implementing information processing at the nanometre scale. Model simulations based on the transport equations further verify the feasibility of the sensing procedure that involves concepts from supramolecular chemistry{,} molecular imprinting{,} recognition{,} and nanotechnology."}

abstract  ="The ability of living systems to respond to stimuli and process information has encouraged scientists to develop integrated nanosystems displaying similar functions and capabilities. In this regard{,} biological pores have been a source of inspiration due to their exquisite control over the transport of ions within cells{,} a feature that ultimately plays a major role in multiple physiological processes{,} e.g. transduction of physical stimuli into nervous signals. Developing abiotic nanopores{,} which respond to certain chemical{,} biological or physical inputs producing {"}iontronic{"} signals{,} is now a reality thanks to the combination of {"}soft{"} surface science with nanofabrication techniques. The interplay between the functional richness of predesigned molecular components and the remarkable physical characteristics of nanopores plays a critical role in the rational integration of molecular functions into nanopore environments{,} permitting us to envisage nanopore-based biomimetic integrated nanosystems that respond to a variety of external stimuli such as pH{,} redox potential{,} molecule concentration{,} temperature{,} or light. Transduction of these stimuli into a predefined {"}iontronic{"} response can be amplified by exploiting nanoconfinement and physico-chemical effects such as charge distribution{,} steric constraints{,} equilibria displacement{,} or local changes in ionic concentration{,} to name but a few examples. While in past decades the focus has been mostly on their fundamental aspects and the in-depth study of their interesting transport properties{,} for several years now nanopore research has started to shift towards specific practical applications. This work is dedicated to bringing together the latest developments in the use of nanopores as {"}iontronic{"} transducing elements. Our aim is to show the wide potential of abiotic nanopores in sensing and signal transduction and also to promote the potential of this technology among doctoral students{,} postdocs{,} and researchers. We believe that even a casual reader of this perspective will not fail to be impressed by the wealth of opportunities that solid-state nanopores can offer to the transduction of biological{,} physical and chemical stimuli."

Equivalence of the two theories in bulk situations is demonstrated in a control study. In simple cylindrical channels, considerable differences are found between the two theories with regard to the concentration profiles in the channel and its conductance properties. These differences are at a maximum in narrow channels with a radius smaller than the Debye length and diminish with increasing radius. Convergence occurs when the channel radius is over 2 Debye lengths. These tests unequivocally demonstrate that the mean-field approximation in the Poisson–Nernst–Planck theory breaks down in narrow ion channels that have radii smaller than the Debye length. "

We have termed this approach {'}template synthesis{'} because the pores within these nanoporous membranes act as templates for the synthesis of nanostructures of the desired material. Because the pores within these membranes are cylindrical and of uniform diameter{,} monodisperse nanocylinders of the desired material are obtained. Depending on the chemistry of the pore wall and material{,} these nanocylinders may be either hollow (a tubule) or solid (a fibril or nanowire).

In this paper{,} we report detecting co-translocational deformation of individual 1{,}2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) nano-liposomes using solid-state nanopores. Electrokinetic translocation through the nanopore caused the soft DOPC liposomes (85 nm diameter) to change their shape{,} which we attribute to the strong electric field strength and physical confinement inside the pore. The experiments were performed at varying transmembrane voltages and the deformation was observed to mount up with increasing applied voltage and followed an exponential trend. Numerical simulations were performed to simulate the concentrated electric field strength inside the nanopore and a field strength of 14 kV cm-1 (at 600 mV applied voltage) was achieved at the pore center. The electric field strength inside the nanopore is much higher than the field strength known to cause deformation of 15-30 [small mu ]m giant membrane vesicles. As a control{,} we also performed experiments with rigid polystyrene beads that did not show any deformation during translocation events{,} which further established our hypothesis of co-translocational deformation of liposomes. Our technique presents an innovative and high throughput means for investigating deformation behavior of soft nano-vesicles."

We demonstrate a bioinspired artificial photo-driven ion pump based on a single polyethylene terephthalate conical nanochannel. The pumping process behaving as an inversion of zero-volt current can be realized by applying ultraviolet irradiation from the large opening. The light energy can accelerate the dissociation of the benzoic acid derivative dimers existing on the inner surface of nanochannel, which consequently produces more mobile carboxyl groups. Enhanced electrostatic interaction between the ions traversing the nanochannel and the charged groups on the inner wall is the key reason for the uphill cation transport behavior. This system creates an ideal experimental and theoretical platform for further development and design of various stimuli-driven and specific ion{\textendash}selective bioinspired ion pumps, which anticipates wide potential applications in biosensing, energy conversion, and desalination.},

abstract  ="The method of producing single track-etched conical nanopores has received considerable attention and found many applications in diverse fields such as biosensing{,} nanofluidics{,} information processing and others. The performance of an asymmetric nanopore is largely determined by its geometry{,} especially by the size and shape of its tip. In this paper we reconstruct the profiles of so-called conical pores fabricated by asymmetric chemical etching of ion tracks in polymer foil. Conductometric measurements during etching and field emission scanning electron microscopy examinations of the resulting pores were employed in order to determine the pore geometry. We demonstrate that the pore constriction geometry evolves through a variety of configurations with advancing time after breakthrough. While immediately after breakthrough the pore tips are trumpet-shaped{,} further etching is strongly affected by osmotic effects which eventually lead to bullet-shaped pore tips. We evidence that the osmotic flow appearing during asymmetric track etching has a determinative effect on pore formation. A convection-diffusion model is presented that semi-quantitatively explains the effect of osmotic processes under asymmetric track etching conditions. In addition{,} a phenomenon of reagent contaminant precipitation in nanopores is reported and discussed."

@article{Ramirez2008,
abstract = {We present a complete theoretical study of the relationship between the structure (tip shape and dimensions) and function (selectivity and rectification) of asymmetric nanopores on the basis of previous experimental studies. The theoretical model uses a continuum approach based on the Nernst-Planck equations. According to our results, the nanopore transport properties, such as current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, conductance, rectification ratio, and selectivity, are dictated mainly by the shape of the pore tip (we have distinguished bullet-like, conical, trumpet-like, and hybrid shapes) and the concentration of pore surface charges. As a consequence, the nanopore performance in practical applications will depend not only on the base and tip openings but also on the pore shape. In particular, we show that the pore opening dimensions estimated from the pore conductance can be very different, depending on the pore shape assumed. The results obtained can also be of practical relevance for the design of nanopores, nanopipettes, and nanoelectrodes, where the electrical interactions between the charges attached to the nanostructure and the mobile charges confined in the reduced volume of the inside solution dictate the device performance in practical applications. Because single tracks are the elementary building blocks for nanoporous membranes, the understanding and control of their individual properties should also be crucial in protein separation, water desalination, and bio-molecule detection using arrays of identical nanopores.},

These interactions give rise to nanometre-scale boundary layers where the properties can strongly differ from the bulk. The chemical potential provides a convenient tool to describe these boundary layers{,} and as such is the focus of this tutorial review. The chemical potential of a solution component describes its energy level{,} which in this boundary layer is strongly influenced by the various interfacial forces between molecules in the wall and in the solution. These forces vary with distance and have a certain limited spatial range{,} which is reflected in the composition and thickness of the boundary layer in which both solute and solvent concentrations differ from their bulk values. We will consider a variety of solutes such as ions{,} uncharged molecules and gases{,} and surfaces that are both hydrophilic and hydrophobic. The boundary layer is oriented normal to the surface{,} but external forces can also be applied in parallel to the surface. Many interesting different nanofluidic transport phenomena then result{,} which will also be briefly mentioned in this tutorial review.

abstract = "The adsorption of mixtures of charged proteins on charged surfaces is studied using a molecular theory. The theory explicitly treats each of the molecular species in the system. The mixtures treated in this work are composed by two types of proteins, dissociated monovalent salt and solvent. The intermolecular and surface interactions include electrostatic, van der Waals and excluded volume. The theory is more general than the Poisson–Boltzmann approach since the size and shape of all the molecular components are explicitly treated. The studies presented in this work concentrate on the differences in competitive adsorption when the proteins in the mixtures differ in their total charge or in the spatial distribution of the charges within the proteins. In the cases of mixtures that differ in the number of charges it is found, as expected, that the particles with the larger charge adsorb in excess. The ratio of adsorbed proteins can vary by 3–5 orders of magnitude by varying the bulk salt concentration from 1 to 100 mM. This is the result of an increase on the adsorption of the proteins with larger charge and an even stronger decrease on the adsorption of the less charged particles. The simple model systems studied provide guidelines on how to separate charge ladder proteins and proteins with different charge distributions. In the case of proteins with the same total charge but different charge distribution, it is found that the partition of the proteins depends upon the bulk composition. However, in general the particles with the highest localized charge tend to adsorb more on the surfaces. The proteins are adsorbed in one or more layers. The structure of the second adsorbed layer is determined mostly by the bulk properties of the solution. In all cases it is found that in the range of salt concentrations studied the number of adsorbed ions from the salt is very large. This is due to competitive adsorption with the proteins and their very low bulk concentration compared to the salt. The limitations of the theory and directions for improvement of the approach as well as the model for the proteins are discussed. "

abstract = { A theoretical methodology is introduced to calculate the low-bias conductance, structure, and composition of long polyelectrolyte-modified nanochannels of arbitrary geometry. This methodology is applied to explore the coupling between acid–base equilibrium and geometry in cylindrical, conical, and trumpet-shaped nanochannels modified by end-grafted layers of poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl-phosphate) (PMEP), a diprotic polyacid. The ionic conductance and speciation curves (i.e., the fraction of deprotonated, monoprotonated, and diprotonated acid segments) for this system were predicted as a function of the solution pH. The apparent pKa’s and widths of the transitions between the different acid–base states determined from the speciation curves depend on the diameter and shape of the nanochannel and the bulk salt concentration. In the limit of wide channels, the apparent pKa’s and widths can be estimated by a simplified analytical model derived from the more general molecular theory. Both the general and the simplified theory predicts that, due to charge-regulation effects, the first acid–base transition (0/–1 transition) is wider than the second one (−1/–2), and both transitions are wider than the ideal one expected for an isolated acid–base group in the bulk. It is also shown that the inflection points of the conductance versus pH curves provide a very good estimation of the apparent pKa’s of the polyelectrolyte for cylindrical channels, but the quality of the estimation decreases for noncylindrical geometries. }

abstract = {The creation of switchable and tunable nanodevices displaying transport properties similar to those observed in biological pores poses a major challenge in molecular nanotechnology. Here, we describe the construction of a fully "abiotic" nanodevice whose transport properties can be accurately controlled by manipulating the proton concentration in the surrounding environment. The ionic current switching characteristics displayed by the nanochannels resemble the typical behavior observed in many biological channels that fulfill key pH-dependent transport functions in living organisms, that is, the nanochannel can be switched from an "off" state to an "on" state in response to a pH drop. The construction of such a chemical nanoarchitecture required the integration of stable and ductile macromolecular building blocks constituted of pH-responsive poly(4-vinyl pyridine) brushes into solid state nanopores that could act as gate-keepers managing and constraining the flow of ionic species through the confined environment. In this context, we envision that the integration of environmental stimuli-responsive brushes into solid-state nanochannels would provide a plethora of new chemical alternatives for molecularly design robust signal-responsive "abiotic" devices mimicking the function of proton-gated ion channels commonly encountered in biological membranes.},

abstract = {Solid state nanochannels modified with supramolecular architectures are a new and interesting class of stimuli-responsive nanofluidic element. Their fundamental understanding requires describing the behavior of soft-materials in confined geometries and its responses to changes in solution conditions. Here, a nanochannel modified with a polyelectrolyte brush is studied with a molecular theory that incorporates the conformational behavior of the polymers, electrostatic, van der Waals, and repulsive interactions coupled with the ability of the polymer segments to regulate their charge through acid-base equilibrium. The theory predicts pH-dependent ionic conductivity in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The polymer chains undergo large conformational changes triggered by variations in the outer solution environment and the conductivity of the device is shown to be controlled by the charge state of the polymer. The degree of polymer charge is largely affected by charge regulation and nanoconfinement effects. The molecular calculations show that the apparent pK(a) inside the pore departs from that in solution when increasing the curvature of the nanochannel.},

abstract = {A model is presented for the electrical potential distribution across a charged biological membrane that is in equilibrium with an electrolyte solution. We assume that a membrane has charged surface layers of thickness d on both surfaces of the membrane, where the fixed charges are distributed at a uniform density N within the layers, and that these charged layers are permeable to electrolyte ions. This model unites two different concepts, that is, the Donnan potential and the surface potential (or the Gouy-Chapman double-layer potential). Namely, the present model leads to the Donnan potential when d much greater than 1/k' (k' is the Debye-H\"{u}ckel parameter of the surface charge layer) and to the surface potential as d----0, keeping the product Nd constant. The potential distribution depends significantly on the thickness d of the surface charge layer when d less than or approximately equal to 1/k'.},

abstract = {Donnan equilibrium between a salt-free colloidal dispersion and an electrolyte solution has been investigated by Monte Carlo simulations. The Donnan potential is directly calculated by considering two compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane. In order to understand the role played by colloid-ion interactions, the influences of colloidal characteristics, including particle size R, intrinsic particle charge Z, counterion valency z(c), and concentration c(p), on Donnan potential Psi(D) and effective charge Z(eff) are examined. Our simulations show that the electroneutrality condition is not followed in both compartments and the Donnan potential arises due to the net charge density. The Donnan potential grows by increasing c(p) and Z(eff) and by decreasing dielectric constant epsilon(r), i.e., Psi(D) approximately Z(eff)c(p)/epsilon(r) approximately. Note that the effective charge varies with R,Z,c(p),epsilon(r) and z(c) as well. When the salt concentration is increased, the net charge density is lowered and thus the Donnan potential decays accordingly. The validity of the classical theory based on the Nernst equation and the electroneutrality assumption is also examined. In general, the simulation results at high-salt condition can be well represented by such mean-field theory.},

    abstract = {The revealing of the “diodelike” properties of electrolyte-filled asymmetric nanopores in track membranes has given significant impetus to a detailed study of the properties of “track” nanocapillaries. Studying the behavior of electrolyte solutions in nanovolumes of a given geometry is very important for many applications, such as nanofluid technology, the resistive pulse method for detecting colloidal particles and molecules, modeling of biological membranes, etc. An attempt to find a quantitative relationship between the geometric shape of asymmetric nanopores and asymmetry in electrical conductivity has been made in this paper. The method of chemical etching in the presence of a surfactant was used for the formation of nanopores with different profiles. The pore structure was studied by electron microscopy. It has been found that the rectification ratio increases with the membrane thickness and depends strongly on the curvature of the pore profile in the selective layer. The maximum of the rectification has been observed in a 0.05–0.1M KCl. Simulation of the ionic conductivity of asymmetric nanopores by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation qualitatively explains the observed behavior. The effect of the asymmetry of electrical conductivity is well expressed even in cases when the pore radius in the selective layer is substantially greater than the Debye length. The modification of the pore surface by grafting of aminopropyltriethoxysilane results in the sign inversion of electric charge and a sharp change in the current-voltage characteristics of the membranes.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the process of voltage driven capture of DNA molecules by nanopores. We show that ionic current generates a nonuniform electric field that acts on both the DNA and on its counterions and that the response of DNA to the electric field is affected by its electroosmotic coupling to the mobile counterions. We calculate the voltage and molecular mass dependence of the radius of capture and of the capture rate in the diffusion limited regime. We argue that electroosmotic flow through the DNA coil is suppressed in the vicinity of the pore and present a tentative estimate of the capture rate in the barrier limited regime.},

abstract = {Molecular design of ionic current rectifiers created on the basis of single conical nanopores is receiving increasing attention by the scientific community. Part of the appeal of this topic relies on the interest in sensors and fluidic nanoactuators based on the transport of ions and molecules through nanopore architectures that can readily be integrated into functional systems. The chemical modification of the pore walls controls not only the diameter of these nanoarchitectures but also their selectivity and transport properties. In order to confer selectivity to solid-state nanopores, it is necessary to develop and explore new methods for functionalizing the pore walls. Hence, the creation of functional nanopores capable of acting as selective ion channels or smart nanofluidic sensors depends critically on our ability to assemble and build up molecular architectures in a predictable manner within confined geometries with dimensions comparable to the size of the building blocks themselves. In this context, layer-by-layer deposition of polyelectrolytes offers a straightforward process for creating nanoscopic supramolecular assemblies displaying a wide variety of functional features. In this work, we describe for the first time the integration of layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte assemblies into single conical nanopores in order to study and explore the functional features arising from the creation of charged supramolecular assemblies within the constrained geometry of the nanofluidic device. To address this challenging topic, we used a combined experimental and theoretical approach to elucidate and quantify the electrostatic changes taking place inside the nanopore during the supramolecular assembly process. The multilayered films were built up through consecutive layer-by-layer adsorption of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) on the pore surface. Our results show that the charge transport properties of single conical nanopores functionalized with PAH/PSS assemblies are highly dependent on the number of layers assembled on the pore wall. In contrast to what happens with PAH/PSS films deposited on planar surfaces (quantitative charge reversal), the surface charge of the pore walls decreases dramatically with the number of PAH/PSS layers assembled into the nanopore. This behavior was attributed to the nanoconfinement-induced structural reorganization of the polyelectrolyte layers, leading to the efficient formation of ion pairs and promoting a marked decrease in the net fixed charges on the nanopore walls. We consider that these results are of paramount relevance for the modification of nanopores, nanopipets, and nanoelectrodes using charged supramolecular assemblies, as well as of importance in "soft nanotechnology" provided that structural complexity, induced by nanoconfinement, can define the functional properties of self-assembled polymeric nanostructures.},

abstract = {When a fluid that undergoes a vapor to liquid transition in the bulk is confined to a long cylindrical pore, the phase transition is shifted (mostly due to surface effects at the walls of the pore) and rounded (due to finite size effects). The nature of the phase coexistence at the transition depends on the length of the pore: for very long pores, the system is axially homogeneous at low temperatures. At the chemical potential where the transition takes place, fluctuations occur between vapor- and liquidlike states of the cylinder as a whole. At somewhat higher temperatures (but still far below bulk criticality), the system at phase coexistence is in an axially inhomogeneous multidomain state, where long cylindrical liquid- and vaporlike domains alternate. Using Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising/lattice gas model and the Asakura-Oosawa model of colloid-polymer mixtures, the transition between these two different scenarios is characterized. It is shown that the density distribution changes gradually from a double-peak structure to a triple-peak shape, and the correlation length in the axial direction (measuring the equilibrium domain length) becomes much smaller than the cylinder length. The (rounded) transition to the disordered phase of the fluid occurs when the axial correlation length has decreased to a value comparable to the cylinder diameter. It is also suggested that adsorption hysteresis vanishes when the transition from the simple domain state to the multidomain state of the cylindrical pore occurs. We predict that the difference between the pore critical temperature and the hysteresis critical temperature should increase logarithmically with the length of the pore.},

Our experimental study as a function of channel height and salt concentration reveals that the highest efficiency occurs when double layers overlap, which corresponds to nanoscale fluidic channels filled with aqueous solutions of low ionic strength. The highest efficiency of approximately 3{\%} was found for a 75 nm high channel, the smallest channel measured. The data are well described by Poisson-Boltzmann theory with an additional electrical conductance of the Stern layer.},

abstract = {In this work we describe for the first time the integration of "smart" polymer brushes into single conical nanopores to obtain a new highly functional signal-responsive chemical nanodevice. The responsive brushes were constituted of zwitterionic monomers whose charge is regulated via pH changes in the environmental conditions. The pH-dependent chemical equilibrium of the monomer units provides a fine-tuning of the ionic transport though the nanopore by simply presetting the pH of the electrolyte solution. Our results demonstrate that this strategy enables a higher degree of control over the rectification properties when compared to the nanochannels modified with charged monolayer assemblies. We envision that these results will create completely new avenues to build-up "smart" nanodevices using responsive polymer brushes integrated into single conical nanopores.},

abstract = {Solid-state nanopores are sensors capable of analysing individual unlabelled DNA molecules in solution. Although the critical information obtained from nanopores (for example, DNA sequence) comes from the signal collected during DNA translocation, the throughput of the method is determined by the rate at which molecules arrive and thread into the pores. Here, we study the process of DNA capture into nanofabricated SiN pores of molecular dimensions. For fixed analyte concentrations we find an increase in capture rate as the DNA length increases from 800 to 8,000 base pairs, a length-independent capture rate for longer molecules, and increasing capture rates when ionic gradients are established across the pore. Furthermore, we show that application of a 20-fold salt gradient allows the detection of picomolar DNA concentrations at high throughput. The salt gradients enhance the electric field, focusing more molecules into the pore, thereby advancing the possibility of analysing unamplified DNA samples using nanopores.},

abstract = {Nanopore analysis is an emerging technique that involves using a voltage to drive molecules through a nanoscale pore in a membrane between two electrolytes, and monitoring how the ionic current through the nanopore changes as single molecules pass through it. This approach allows charged polymers (including single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA and RNA) to be analysed with subnanometre resolution and without the need for labels or amplification. Recent advances suggest that nanopore-based sensors could be competitive with other third-generation DNA sequencing technologies, and may be able to rapidly and reliably sequence the human genome for under {\$}1,000. In this article we review the use of nanopore technology in DNA sequencing, genetics and medical diagnostics.},

abstract = {There has been an increasing interest in single nanochannel ionic devices, such as ionic filters that control the type of transported ions and ionic diodes that rectify the ionic flow. In this article, we theoretically investigate the importance of the dimensions, surface charge, electrolyte concentration, and applied bias on nanopore performance. We compare numerical solutions of the Poisson, Nernst-Planck (PNP), and Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with their one-dimensional, analytical approximations. We show that by decreasing the length of the nanopore, the ionic current and ionic selectivity become affected by processes outside the nanochannel. The contribution of electroosmosis is noticeable, especially for highly charged nanochannels, but is insignificant, justifying the use of the simple one-dimensional approximation in many cases. Estimates for the critical electric field at which the nanopore selectivity decreases and the ion current starts to saturate are provided.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the fluctuation theorem for channel-facilitated transport of solutes through a membrane separating two reservoirs. The transport is characterized by the probability, P(n)(t), that n solute particles have been transported from one reservoir to the other in time t. The fluctuation theorem establishes a relation between P(n)(t) and P-(n)(t): The ratio P(n)(t)/P-(n)(t) is independent of time and equal to exp(nbetaA), where betaA is the affinity measured in the thermal energy units. We show that the same fluctuation theorem is true for both single- and multichannel transport of noninteracting particles and particles which strongly repel each other.},

abstract = {Single nanometre-sized pores (nanopores) embedded in an insulating membrane are an exciting new class of nanosensors for rapid electrical detection and characterization of biomolecules. Notable examples include alpha-hemolysin protein nanopores in lipid membranes and solid-state nanopores in Si3N4. Here we report a new technique for fabricating silicon oxide nanopores with single-nanometre precision and direct visual feedback, using state-of-the-art silicon technology and transmission electron microscopy. First, a pore of 20 nm is opened in a silicon membrane by using electron-beam lithography and anisotropic etching. After thermal oxidation, the pore can be reduced to a single-nanometre when it is exposed to a high-energy electron beam. This fluidizes the silicon oxide leading to a shrinking of the small hole due to surface tension. When the electron beam is switched off, the material quenches and retains its shape. This technique dramatically increases the level of control in the fabrication of a wide range of nanodevices.},

@article{Facciotti2004,
abstract = {Recent crystallographic structures of three different ion pumps provide a first view of the mechanisms by which these molecular machines transfer ions across cell membranes against an electrochemical gradient. Each of the structures reinforces the concept that several buried counter ions have central roles in substrate recruitment, substrate binding and energy transduction during ion pumping. The spatial organization of the counter ions suggests that, initially, one or more counter ions lowers the Born energy cost of binding a substrate ion in the low-dielectric interior of the membrane. Subsequently, a ligand-induced conformational change seems to close a charged access gate to prevent backflow from a subsequent, low-affinity state of the pump. A final role of the buried counter ions might be to couple the input of external energy to a small charge separation between the substrate ion and the buried counter ions, thereby decreasing the binding affinity for the substrate ion in preparation for its release on the high-energy side of the membrane.},

abstract = {The integration of a microchannel with a nanochannel is known to exhibit anomalous nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. In this paper, we perform detailed numerical simulations considering a 2-D nonlinear ion transport model, to capture and explain the underlying physics behind the limiting resistance and the overlimiting current regions, observed predominantly in a highly ion-selective nanochannel. We attribute the overlimiting current characteristics to the redistribution of the space charges resulting in an anomalous enhancement in the ionic concentration of the electrolyte in the induced space charge region, beyond a critical voltage. The overlimiting current with constant conductivity is predicted even without considering the effects of fluidic nonlinearities. We extend our study and report anomalous rectification effects, resulting in an enhancement of current in the non-ohmic region, under the application of combined AC and DC electric fields. The necessary criteria to observe these enhancements and some useful scaling relations are discussed.},

abstract = {We report selective ionic transport through controlled, high-density, subnanometer diameter pores in macroscopic single-layer graphene membranes. Isolated, reactive defects were first introduced into the graphene lattice through ion bombardment and subsequently enlarged by oxidative etching into permeable pores with diameters of 0.40 ± 0.24 nm and densities exceeding 10(12) cm(-2), while retaining structural integrity of the graphene. Transport measurements across ion-irradiated graphene membranes subjected to in situ etching revealed that the created pores were cation-selective at short oxidation times, consistent with electrostatic repulsion from negatively charged functional groups terminating the pore edges. At longer oxidation times, the pores allowed transport of salt but prevented the transport of a larger organic molecule, indicative of steric size exclusion. The ability to tune the selectivity of graphene through controlled generation of subnanometer pores addresses a significant challenge in the development of advanced nanoporous graphene membranes for nanofiltration, desalination, gas separation, and other applications.},

abstract = {The preparation of an asymmetric membrane in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is described, using a combination of chemical and electro-stopping. For this purpose, a single-ion-irradiated PET film is inserted into an electrolytic cell and etched from one side in 9 M sodium hydroxide while bathing the other side in a mixture of 2 M KCl and 2 M HCOOH (1:1 by volume), electrically retracting the OH- ions from the tip of the etch pit during pore break-through. When a preset current has been reached, the etch process is interrupted by replacing the etching solution with acidic 1 M potassium chloride solution. After etching, the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic is determined under symmetric bathing conditions, immersing both sides of the membrane in KCl solutions of identical concentration (0.01-1 M) and pH (3-8). The I-V characteristic is strongly non-linear, comparable to that of an electrical diode. If the polarity during etching is reversed, pushing the OH- ions into the tip of the etch pit, the resulting pores are larger and the degree of asymmetry smaller. The importance of electro-stopping is compared with chemical stopping. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The development of solid-state nanopores, inspired by their biological counterparts, shows great potential for the study of single macromolecules. Applications such as DNA sequencing and the exploration of protein folding require control of the dynamics of the molecule's interaction with the pore, but DNA capture by a solid-state nanopore is not well understood. By recapturing individual molecules soon after they pass through a nanopore, we reveal the mechanism by which double-stranded DNA enters the pore. The observed recapture rates and times agree with solutions of a drift-diffusion model. Electric forces draw DNA to the pore over micrometer-scale distances, and upon arrival at the pore, molecules begin translocation almost immediately. Repeated translocation of the same molecule improves measurement accuracy, offers a way to probe the chemical transformations and internal dynamics of macromolecules on sub-millisecond time and sub-micrometre length scales, and demonstrates the ability to trap, study and manipulate individual macromolecules in solution.},

@article{Xie2012,
abstract = {Nanopores could potentially be used to perform single-molecule DNA sequencing at low cost and with high throughput. Although single base resolution and differentiation have been demonstrated with nanopores using ionic current measurements, direct sequencing has not been achieved because of the difficulties in recording very small (∼pA) ionic currents at a bandwidth consistent with fast translocation speeds. Here, we show that solid-state nanopores can be combined with silicon nanowire field-effect transistors to create sensors in which detection is localized and self-aligned at the nanopore. Well-defined field-effect transistor signals associated with DNA translocation are recorded when an ionic strength gradient is imposed across the nanopores. Measurements and modelling show that field-effect transistor signals are generated by highly localized changes in the electrical potential during DNA translocation, and that nanowire-nanopore sensors could enable large-scale integration with a high intrinsic bandwidth.},

abstract = {The present article describes the preparation and preliminary characterization of a novel phosphate-functionalized self-assembled monolayer (SAM) and the determination of the surface ionization states of the phosphate headgroup in aqueous solutions by chemical force microscopy (CFM). The phosphate headgroup used was PO(OH)2, a diprotic acid. The adhesion force between an AFM probe and a flat substrate, both of which were chemically modified with the same phosphate SAM, was also measured as a function of pH and ionic strength. At low ionic strength (10(-4) M), two peaks were observed in the force titration curve (adhesion force versus pH) at pH 4.5 and 8.4. The two peaks are positioned 2.4 and 1.2 pH units higher, respectively, than the acid dissociation constants obtained for the phosphate group free in aqueous solution. At high ionic strength (10(-1) M), the adhesion forces were reduced by 1 order of magnitude and the peaks were replaced by shoulders similar to those previously reported for acid force titrations. On the basis of JKR theory, the surface pKa values of the phosphate group in high ionic strength solutions were found to be 4.5 and 7.7, respectively. However, in light of the effects of ionic strength on the force titration curves, we discuss the applicability of JKR theory to nanoscopic measurements of adhesion force and surface pKa.},

abstract = {We report a nanofluidic transistor based on a metal-oxide-solution (MOSol) system that is similar to a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Using a combination of fluorescence and electrical measurements, we demonstrate that gate voltage modulates the concentration of ions and molecules in the channel and controls the ionic conductance. Our results illustrate the efficacy of field-effect control in nanofluidics, which could have broad implications on integrated nanofluidic circuits for manipulation of ions and biomolecules in sub-femtoliter volumes.},

abstract = {Herein we demonstrate a fully abiotic smart single-nanopore device that rectifies ionic current in response to the temperature. The temperature-responsive nanopore ionic rectifier can be switched between a rectifying state below 34 degrees C and a non-rectifying state above 38 degrees C actuated by the phase transition of the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) [PNIPAM] brushes. On the rectifying state, the rectifying efficiency can be enhanced by the dehydration of the attached PNIPAM brushes below the LCST. When the PNIPAM brushes have sufficiently collapsed, the nanopore switches to the non-rectifying state. The concept of the temperature-responsive current rectification in chemically-modified nanopores paves a new way for controlling the preferential direction of the ion transport in nanofluidics by modulating the temperature, which has the potential to build novel nanomachines with smart fluidic communication functions for future lab-on-chip devices.},

abstract = {A simple numerical method, which does not involve numerical integration of the Poisson-Boltzmann equations, is presented for obtaining the relationship between the Donnan potential and surface potential of a spherical soft particle (i.e., a polyelectrolyte-coated particle) in a symmetrical electrolyte solution. We assume that a soft particle consists of the particle core of radius a covered with an ion-penetrable surface layer of polyelectrolytes of thickness d and that ionized groups of valence Z are distributed at a uniform density of N in the polyelectrolyte layer and the relative permittivity takes the same value in the regions outside and inside the polyelectrolyte layer. The Donnan potential and surface potential are determined by the values of a, d, Z, N, and the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel parameter kappa of the electrolyte solution. Numerical results obtained by the present method are in excellent agreement with exact results obtained by solving the nonlinear spherical Poisson-Boltzmann equations for the both regions inside and outside the polyelectrolyte layer.},

abstract = {Nature provides a huge range of biological materials, just as ion channels, with various smart functions over millions of years of evolution, and which serve as a big source of bio-inspiration for biomimetic materials. In this critical review, a strategy for the design and synthesis of biomimetic smart nanopores and nanochannels is presented and put into context with recent progress in this rapidly growing field from biological, inorganic, organic to composite nanopore and nanochannel materials, which can respond to single/multiple external stimuli, e.g., pH, temperature, light, and so on. This review is intended to utilize a specific responsive behavior for regulating ionic transport properties inside the single nanopore or nanochannel as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the design strategy, and provide an overview of this fascinating research field (109 references).},

abstract = {Chemically modified nanopores show a strong and nontrivial coupling between ion current and the structure of the immobilized species. In this work we study theoretically the conductance and structure in polymer modified nanopores and explicitly address the problem of the coupling between ion transport and molecular organization. Our approach is based on a nonequilibrium molecular theory that couples ion conductivity with the conformational degrees of freedom of the polymer and the electrostatic and nonelectrostatic interactions among polyelectrolyte chains, ions, and solvent. We apply the theory to study a cylindrical nanopore between two reservoirs as a function of pore diameter and length, the length of the polyelectrolyte chains, their grafting density, and whether they are present or not on the outer reservoir walls. In the very low applied potential regime, where the distribution of polyelectrolyte and ions is similar to that in equilibrium, we present a simple analytical model based on the combination of the different resistances in the system that describes the conductance in excellent agreement with the calculations of the full nonequilibrium molecular theory. On the other hand, for a large applied potential bias, the theory predicts a dramatic reorganization of the polyelectrolyte chains and the ions. This reorganization results from the global optimization of the different interactions in the system under nonequilibrium conditions. For nanopores modified with long chains, this reorganization leads to two interesting physical phenomena: (i) control of polyelectrolyte morphology by the direction and magnitude of ion-fluxes and (ii) an unexpected decrease in system resistance with the applied potential bias for long chains due to the coupling between polyelectrolyte segment distribution and ion currents.},

abstract = {Recently we predicted that when a reaction involving a small number of molecules occurs in a nanometric-scale domain entirely segregated from the surrounding media, the nanoconfinement can shift the position of equilibrium toward products via reactant-product reduced mixing. In this Letter, we demonstrate how most-recently reported single-molecule fluorescence measurements of partial hybridization of ssDNA confined within nanofabricated chambers provide the first experimental confirmation of this entropic nanoconfinement effect. Thus, focusing separately on each occupancy-specific equilibrium constant, quantitatively reveals extra stabilization of the product upon decreasing the chamber occupancy or size. Namely, the DNA hybridization under nanoconfined conditions is significantly favored over the identical reaction occurring in bulk media with the same reactant concentrations. This effect, now directly verified for DNA, can be relevant to actual biological processes, as well as to diverse reactions occurring within molecular capsules, nanotubes, and other functional nanospaces.},

abstract = {Fundamental understanding of ion transport phenomena in nanopores is crucial for designing the next-generation nanofluidic devices. Due to surface reactions of dissociable functional groups on the nanopore wall, the surface charge density highly depends upon the proton concentration on the nanopore wall, which in turn affects the electrokinetic transport of ions, fluid, and particles within the nanopore. Electrokinetic ion transport in a pH-regulated nanopore, taking into account both multiple ionic species and charge regulation on the nanopore wall, is theoretically investigated for the first time. The model is verified by the experimental data of nanopore conductance available in the literature. The results demonstrate that the spatial distribution of the surface charge density at the nanopore wall and the resulting ion transport phenomena, such as ion concentration polarization (ICP), ion selectivity, and conductance, are significantly affected by the background solution properties, such as the pH and salt concentration.},

abstract = {Biological protein channels have many remarkable properties such as gating, high permeability, and selectivity, which have motivated researchers to mimic their functions for practical applications. Herein, using molecular dynamics simulations, we design bioinspired nanopores in graphene sheets that can discriminate between Na(+) and K(+), two ions with very similar properties. The simulation results show that, under transmembrane voltage bias, a nanopore containing four carbonyl groups to mimic the selectivity filter of the KcsA K(+) channel preferentially conducts K(+) over Na(+). A nanopore functionalized by four negatively charged carboxylate groups to mimic the selectivity filter of the NavAb Na(+) channel selectively binds Na(+) but transports K(+) over Na(+). Surprisingly, the ion selectivity of the smaller diameter pore containing three carboxylate groups can be tuned by changing the magnitude of the applied voltage bias. Under lower voltage bias, it transports ions in a single-file manner and exhibits Na(+) selectivity, dictated by the knock-on ion conduction and selective blockage by Na(+). Under higher voltage bias, the nanopore is K(+)-selective, as the blockage by Na(+) is destabilized and the stronger affinity for carboxylate groups slows the passage of Na(+) compared with K(+). The computational design of biomimetic ion-selective nanopores helps to understand the mechanisms of selectivity in biological ion channels and may also lead to a wide range of potential applications such as sensitive ion sensors, nanofiltration membranes for Na(+)/K(+) separation, and voltage-tunable nanofluidic devices.},

abstract = {We combine for the first time optical tweezer experiments with the resistive pulse technique based on capillaries. Quartz glass capillaries are pulled into a conical shape with tip diameters as small as 27 nm. Here, we discuss the translocation of $\lambda$-phage DNA which is driven by an electrophoretic force through the nanocapillary. The resulting change in ionic current indicates the folding state of single $\lambda$-phage DNA molecules. Our flow cell design allows for the straightforward incorporation of optical tweezers. We show that a DNA molecule attached to an optically trapped colloid is pulled into a capillary by electrophoretic forces. The detected electrophoretic force is in good agreement with measurements in solid-state nanopores.},

abstract = {In polymer films carrying an excess of fixed charge the electrostatic penalty to bring ions of same charge from the bathing electrolyte into the film sets a membrane potential (Donnan Potential) across the film-electrolyte interface. This potential is responsible for the ionic permselectivity observed in polyelectrolyte membranes. We have used electrochemical measurements to probe the dependence of the Donnan potential on the acid-base equilibrium in layer-by-layer self-assembled polyelectrolyte multilayers. The voltammperogram peak position of the Os(III)/Os(II) couple in self-assembled polyelectrolyte multilayers comprised of poly(allylamine) derivatized with Os(bpy)(2)PyCl+ and poly(vinylsulfonate) was recorded in solutions of increasing ionic strength for different assembly and testing solution pH. Protonation-deprotonation of the weak redox poly(allylamine) changes the fixed charge population in the as prepared (intrinsic) self-assembled redox polyelectrolyte multilayers. For films assembled in solutions of pH higher than the test solution pH, the Donnan plots (E(app) vs log C) exhibit a negative slope (anionic exchanger) while for films assembled at lower pH than that of the test solution positive slopes (cationic exchanger) are apparent. The ion exchange mechanism has been supported by complementary electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy experiments demonstrated that the as prepared films have a memory effect on their protonation state during assembly, which leads to the observed dependence of the Donnan potential on the adsorption pH.},

abstract = {Solid-state nanopores have been widely employed in sensing applications from Coulter counters to DNA sequencing devices. The analytical signal in such experiments is the change in ionic current flowing through the orifice caused by the large molecule or nanoparticle translocation through the pore. Conceptually similar nanopipette-based sensors can offer several advantages including the ease of fabrication and small physical size essential for local measurements and experiments in small spaces. This paper describes the first evaluation of nanopipettes with well characterized geometry for resistive-pulse sensing of Au nanoparticles (AuNP), nanoparticles coated with an allergen epitope peptide layer, and AuNP-peptide particles with bound antipeanut antibodies (IgY) on the peptide layer. The label-free signal produced by IgY-conjugated particles was strikingly different from those obtained with other analytes, thus suggesting the possibility of selective and sensitive resistive-pulse sensing of antibodies.},

A number of interesting phenomena are discussed for nanochannels with feature sizes that are manufacturable with modern photolithography-based fabrication technology. The use of spectroscopic methods to investigate chemistry in nanochannels, where both spectroscopic method and nanochannels are integrated into a single device, will be evaluated.},

abstract = {In polymer films carrying an excess of fixed charge the electrostatic penalty to bring ions of same charge from the bathing electrolyte into the film sets a membrane potential (Donnan Potential) across the film-electrolyte interface. This potential is responsible for the ionic permselectivity observed in polyelectrolyte membranes. We have used electrochemical measurements to probe the dependence of the Donnan potential on the acid-base equilibrium in layer-by-layer self-assembled polyelectrolyte multilayers. The voltammperogram peak position of the Os(III)/Os(II) couple in self-assembled polyelectrolyte multilayers comprised of poly(allylamine) derivatized with Os(bpy)(2)PyCl+ and poly(vinylsulfonate) was recorded in solutions of increasing ionic strength for different assembly and testing solution pH. Protonation-deprotonation of the weak redox poly(allylamine) changes the fixed charge population in the as prepared (intrinsic) self-assembled redox polyelectrolyte multilayers. For films assembled in solutions of pH higher than the test solution pH, the Donnan plots (E(app) vs log C) exhibit a negative slope (anionic exchanger) while for films assembled at lower pH than that of the test solution positive slopes (cationic exchanger) are apparent. The ion exchange mechanism has been supported by complementary electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy experiments demonstrated that the as prepared films have a memory effect on their protonation state during assembly, which leads to the observed dependence of the Donnan potential on the adsorption pH.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in the concept of using nanopores as the sensing elements in biosensors. The nanopore most often used is the alpha-hemolysin protein channel, and the sensor consists of a single channel embedded within a lipid bilayer membrane. An ionic current is passed through the channel, and analyte species are detected as transient blocks in this current associated with translocation of the analyte through the channel-stochastic sensing. While this is an extremely promising sensing paradigm, it would be advantageous to eliminate the very fragile lipid bilayer membrane and perhaps to replace the biological nanopore with an abiotic equivalent. We describe here a new family of protein biosensors that are based on conically shaped gold nanotubes embedded within a mechanical and chemically robust polymeric membrane. While these sensors also function by passing an ion current through the nanotube, the sensing paradigm is different from the previous devices in that a transient change in the current is not observed. Instead, the protein analyte binds to a biochemical molecular-recognition agent at the mouth of the conical nanotube, resulting in complete blockage of the ion current. Three different molecular-recognition agents, and correspondingly three different protein analytes, were investigated: (i) biotin/streptavidin, (ii) protein-G/immunoglobulin, and (iii) an antibody to the protein ricin with ricin as the analyte.},

The focus of this tutorial review is the stretching of DNA in nanoscale channels for coarse-grained mapping of DNA. To understand the behavior of the DNA, basic theory is discussed. Experimental details are revealed so that the reader, with the proper equipment, should be able to perform experiments. Basic approaches to the analysis of the data are discussed. Finally, potential future directions are discussed including the application of melting mapping as a simple barcode for the DNA.},

abstract = {The binding of small proteins to ligands that are attached to the free ends of polymers tethered to a planar surface is studied using a molecular theory. The effects of changing the intrinsic binding equilibrium constant of the ligand-receptor pair, the polymer surface coverage, the polymer molecular weight, and the protein size are studied. The results are also compared with the case where ligands are directly attached to the surface without a polymer acting as a spacer. We found that within the biological range of binding constants the protein adsorption is enhanced by the presence of the polymer spacers. There is always an optimal surface coverage for which ligand-receptor binding is a maximum. This maximum increases as the binding energy and/or the polymer molecular weight increase. The presence of the maximum is due to the ability of the polymer-bound proteins to form a thick layer by dispersing the ligands in space to optimize binding and minimize lateral repulsions. The fraction of bound receptors is unity for a very small surface coverage of ligands. The very sharp decrease in the fraction of bound ligand-receptor pairs with surface coverage depends on the polymer spacer chain length. We found that the binding of proteins is reduced as the size of the protein increases. The orientation of the bound proteins can be manipulated by proper choice of the grafted layer conditions. At high polymer surface coverage the bound proteins are predominantly perpendicular to the surface, while at low surface coverage there is a more random distribution of orientations. To avoid nonspecific adsorption on the surface, we studied the case where the surface is covered by a mixture of a relatively high molecular weight polymer with a ligand attached to its free end and a low molecular weight polymer without ligand. These systems present a maximum in the binding of proteins, which is of the same magnitude as when only the long polymer-ligand is present. Moreover, when the total surface coverage in the mixed layers of polymers is high enough, nonspecific adsorption of the proteins on the surface is suppressed. The use of the presented theoretical results for the design of surface modifiers with tailored abilities for specific binding of proteins and optimal nonfouling capabilities is discussed.},

abstract = {Over millions of years, complex processes of intelligent control have evolved in nature. Learning from nature is a continuing theme in the development of smart materials and intelligent systems. For example, biological nanochannels, which are typically ion channels, play a very important role in basic biochemical processes in cells. Inspired by ion channels, in which the components are asymmetrically distributed between the membrane surfaces, the generation of biomimetic smart nanochannels is a broad and varied scientific research field. The design and development of new biomimetic channels includes the use of different shapes of channels, different stimuli-responsive molecules, and different symmetric/asymmetric modification methods. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments in building functional nanochannels by applying various symmetric and asymmetric modifications.},

@article{Nap2014,
abstract = {This work addresses the effect of the Born self-energy contribution in the modeling of the structural and thermodynamical properties of weak polyelectrolytes confined to planar and curved surfaces. The theoretical framework is based on a theory that explicitly includes the conformations, size, shape, and charge distribution of all molecular species and considers the acid-base equilibrium of the weak polyelectrolyte. Namely, the degree of charge in the polymers is not imposed but it is a local varying property that results from the minimization of the total free energy. Inclusion of the dielectric properties of the polyelectrolyte is important as the environment of a polymer layer is very different from that in the adjacent aqueous solution. The main effect of the Born energy contribution on the molecular organization of an end-grafted weak polyacid layer is uncharging the weak acid (or basic) groups and consequently decreasing the concentration of mobile ions within the layer. The magnitude of the effect increases with polymer density and, in the case of the average degree of charge, it is qualitatively equivalent to a small shift in the equilibrium constant for the acid-base equilibrium of the weak polyelectrolyte monomers. The degree of charge is established by the competition between electrostatic interactions, the polymer conformational entropy, the excluded volume interactions, the translational entropy of the counterions and the acid-base chemical equilibrium. Consideration of the Born energy introduces an additional energetic penalty to the presence of charged groups in the polyelectrolyte layer, whose effect is mitigated by down-regulating the amount of charge, i.e., by shifting the local-acid base equilibrium towards its uncharged state. Shifting of the local acid-base equilibrium and its effect on the properties of the polyelectrolyte layer, without considering the Born energy, have been theoretically predicted previously. Account of the Born energy leads to systematic, but in general small, corrections to earlier theoretical predictions describing the behavior of weak polyelectrolyte layers. However, polyelectrolyte uncharging results in a decrease in the concentration of counterions and inclusion of the Born Energy can result in a substantial decrease of the counterion concentration. The effect of considering the Born energy contribution is explored for end-grafted weak polyelectrolyte layers by calculating experimental observables which are known to depend on the presence of charges within the polyelectrolyte layer: inclusion of the Born energy contribution leads to a decrease in the capacitance of polyelectrolyte-modified electrodes, a decrease of conductivity of polyelectrolyte-modified nanopores and an increase in the repulsion exerted by a planar polyelectrolyte layer confined by an opposing wall.},

The chemical rules for ensembles of molar size (N approximately N(A)=6.022 x 10(23)) are well known and can be understood in most cases by using Boltzmann distribution. It is an interesting question how a small ensemble of a chemical system behaves and if it differs from the respective large-ensemble counterpart. The experimental approach presented in the current paper involves the division of a macroscopic volume into compartments that contain only a small number of reactants. The compartments represent the pores of tailor-made nanoporous materials.},

abstract = {Over millions of years, complex processes of intelligent control have evolved in nature. Learning from nature is a continuing theme in the development of smart materials and intelligent systems. For example, biological nanochannels, which are typically ion channels, play a very important role in basic biochemical processes in cells. Inspired by ion channels, in which the components are asymmetrically distributed between the membrane surfaces, the generation of biomimetic smart nanochannels is a broad and varied scientific research field. The design and development of new biomimetic channels includes the use of different shapes of channels, different stimuli-responsive molecules, and different symmetric/asymmetric modification methods. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments in building functional nanochannels by applying various symmetric and asymmetric modifications.},

@article{Tagliazucchi2010f,
abstract = {The competition between chemical equilibrium, for example protonation, and physical interactions determines the molecular organization and functionality of biological and synthetic systems. Charge regulation by displacement of acid-base equilibrium induced by changes in the local environment provides a feedback mechanism that controls the balance between electrostatic, van der Waals, steric interactions and molecular organization. Which strategies do responsive systems follow to globally optimize chemical equilibrium and physical interactions? We address this question by theoretically studying model layers of end-grafted polyacids. These layers spontaneously form self-assembled aggregates, presenting domains of controlled local pH and whose morphologies can be manipulated by the composition of the solution in contact with the film. Charge regulation stabilizes micellar domains over a wide range of pH by reducing the local charge in the aggregate at the cost of chemical free energy and gaining in hydrophobic interactions. This balance determines the boundaries between different aggregate morphologies. We show that a qualitatively new form of organization arises from the coupling between physical interactions and protonation equilibrium. This optimization strategy presents itself with polyelectrolytes coexisting in two different and well-defined protonation states. Our results underline the need of considering the coupling between chemical equilibrium and physical interactions due to their highly nonadditive behavior. The predictions provide guidelines for the creation of responsive polymer layers presenting self-organized patterns with functional properties and they give insights for the understanding of competing interactions in highly inhomogeneous and constrained environments such as those relevant in nanotechnology and those responsible for biological cells function.},

abstract = {There is a growing quest for tailorable nanochannels or nanopores having dimensions comparable to the size of biological molecules and mimicking the function of biological ion channels. This interest is based on the use of nanochannels as extremely sensitive single molecule biosensors. The biosensing capabilities of these nanochannels depend sensitively on the surface characteristics of their inner walls to achieve the desired functionality of the biomimetic system. Nanoscale control over the surface properties of the nanochannel plays a crucial role in the biosensing performance due to the chemical groups incorporated on the inner channel walls that act as binding sites for different analytes and interact with molecules passing through the channel. Here we report a new approach to incorporate biosensing elements into polymer nanochannels by using electrostatic self-assembly. We describe a facile strategy based on the use of bifunctional macromolecular ligands to electrostatically assemble biorecongnition sites into the nanochannel wall, which can then be used as recognition elements for constructing a nanobiosensor. The experimental results demonstrate that the ligand-functionalized nanochannels are very stable and the biorecognition event (protein conjugation) does not promote the removal of the ligands from the channel surface. In addition, control experiments indicated that the electrostatically assembled nanochannel surface displays good biospecificity and nonfouling properties. Then, we demonstrate that this approach also enables the creation of supramolecular multilayered structures inside the nanopore that are stabilized by strong ligand-receptor interactions. We envision that the formation of multilayered supramolecular assemblies inside solid-state nanochannels will play a key role in the further expansion of the toolbox called "soft nanotechnology", as well as in the construction of new multifunctional biomimetic systems.},

@article{Tagliazucchi2013a,
abstract = {This work reports a comprehensive theoretical study of the transport-rectification properties of cylindrical nanopores with neutral inner walls and chemically modified outer membrane. The chemical species on the two outer sides of the membrane have charges of opposite sign and can be either surface-confined species (i.e., surface charges) or polyelectrolyte brushes. The advantage of this design over other types of rectifying nanopores is that it requires controlling the composition of the outer walls of the pore (which are easy to access) rather than the inner walls, thus simplifying the fabrication process. Ion-current rectification in nanopores with charged outer walls is ascribed to applied-potential-induced changes in the ionic concentration within the pore. The rectification efficiency is studied as a function of pore length, radius, surface charge and bulk electrolyte concentration. An analytical model is derived for the case of surface-confined charges that predicts the current-potential curves in very good agreement with the numerical calculations. Neutral nanopores with polyelectrolyte-modified outer walls have two distinct advantages compared to surface-charged systems: (i) they exhibit higher rectification factors due to the large charge density immobilized by the polyelectrolyte brushes, and (ii) the applied potential deforms the polyelectrolyte chains toward the oppositely charged electrode. This deformation brings the polyelectrolyte brushes into the pore in the low conductivity state and expels them from the pore in the high conductivity regime. Calculations of the potentials of mean-force suggest that the applied-field-induced conformational changes can be used to control the translocation of cargoes larger than ions, such as proteins and nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Small RNA molecules have an important role in gene regulation and RNA silencing therapy, but it is challenging to detect these molecules without the use of time-consuming radioactive labelling assays or error-prone amplification methods. Here, we present a platform for the rapid electronic detection of probe-hybridized microRNAs from cellular RNA. In this platform, a target microRNA is first hybridized to a probe. This probe:microRNA duplex is then enriched through binding to the viral protein p19. Finally, the abundance of the duplex is quantified using a nanopore. Reducing the thickness of the membrane containing the nanopore to 6 nm leads to increased signal amplitudes from biomolecules, and reducing the diameter of the nanopore to 3 nm allows the detection and discrimination of small nucleic acids based on differences in their physical dimensions. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by detecting picogram levels of a liver-specific miRNA from rat liver RNA.},

@article{Pevarnik2013,
abstract = {In this article, we report detection of deformable, hydrogel particles by the resistive-pulse technique using single pores in a polymer film. The hydrogels pass through the pores by electroosmosis and cause formation of a characteristic shape of resistive pulses indicating the particles underwent dehydration and deformation. These effects were explained via a non-homogeneous pressure distribution along the pore axis modeled by the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes equations. The local pressure drops are induced by the electroosmotic fluid flow. Our experiments also revealed the importance of concentration polarization in the detection of hydrogels. Due to the negative charges as well as branched, low-density structure of the hydrogel particles, the concentration of ions in the particles is significantly higher than in the bulk. As a result, when an electric field is applied across the membrane, a depletion zone can be created in the vicinity of the particle observed as a transient drop of the current. Our experiments using pores with openings between 200 and 1600 nm indicated the concentration polarization dominated the hydrogels' detection of pores wider than 450 nm. The results are of importance for all studies that involve transport of molecules, particles, and cells through pores with charged walls. The developed inhomogeneous pressure distribution can potentially influence the shape of the transported species. The concentration polarization changes the interpretation of the resistive pulses; the observed current change does not necessarily reflect only the particle size but also the size of the depletion zone that is formed in the particle vicinity.},

As an introduction, a general overview is given on conventional DNA analysis tools, as well as tools under development towards the {\$}1000 genome. The focus of this tutorial review is the stretching of DNA in nanoscale channels for coarse-grained mapping of DNA. To understand the behavior of the DNA, basic theory is discussed. Experimental details are revealed so that the reader, with the proper equipment, should be able to perform experiments. Basic approaches to the analysis of the data are discussed. Finally, potential future directions are discussed including the application of melting mapping as a simple barcode for the DNA.},

When the surface charge densities at the right and left halves of a channel are the same absolute value but of different signs, this could form the basis of a nanofluidic diode. When the surface charge density at the middle part of a channel is modified, this could form the basis of a nanofluidic bipolar transistor.},

abstract = {We show both theoretically and experimentally that the ion-selectivity of a conic nanopore, as defined by a normalized density of the surface charge, significantly affects ion current rectification across the pore. For weakly selective negatively charged pores, intra-pore ion transport controls the current and internal ion enrichment/depletion at positive/reverse biased voltage (current enters/leaves through the tip, respectively), which is responsible for current rectification. For strongly selective negatively charged pores under positive bias, the current can be reduced by external field focusing and concentration depletion at the tip at low ionic strengths and high voltages, respectively. These external phenomena produce a rectification inversion for highly selective pores at high (low) voltage (ionic strength). With an asymptotic analysis of the intra-pore and external ion transport, we derive simple scaling laws to quantitatively capture empirical and numerical data for ion current rectification and rectification inversion of conic nanopores.},

In this review, we explore biomimetic nanopores and nanochannels. Biological systems are full of nano-scale channels and pores that inspire us to devise artificial pores that demonstrate molecular selectivity or other functional advantages. Moreover, with a biomimetic approach, we can also study biological pores, through bottom-up engineering approaches whereby constituent components can be investigated outside the complex cellular environment.},

Previously, experiments have been restricted to naturally occurring nanopores, but advances in technology now allow artificial solid-state nanopores to be fabricated in insulating membranes. By monitoring ion currents and forces as molecules pass through a solid-state nanopore, it is possible to investigate a wide range of phenomena involving DNA, RNA and proteins. The solid-state nanopore proves to be a surprisingly versatile new single-molecule tool for biophysics and biotechnology.},

Using the PNP model for theoretical simulation can help to investigate the ICR properties, as well as to calculate the rectification ratio and profile of ion concentration along the channel. In this review, we will present the main factors that will influence the ICR effect, which are the surface charge density, the electrolyte solution concentration gradient, and the shape or geometry of the nano-pore. The applications of the PNP model used for the theoretical simulation on these factors will also be discussed.},

abstract = {Modern track-etching methods allow the preparation of membranes containing a single charged conical nanopore that shows high ionic permselectivity due to the electrical interactions of the surface pore charges with the mobile ions in the aqueous solution. The nanopore has potential applications in electrically assisted single-particle detection, analysis, and separation of biomolecules. We present a detailed theoretical and experimental account of the effects of pore radii and electrolyte concentration on the current-voltage and current-concentration curves. The physical model used is based on the Nernst-Planck and Poisson equations. Since the validity of continuum models for the description of ion transport under different voltages and concentrations is recognized as one of the main issues in the modeling of future applications, special attention is paid to the fundamental understanding of the electrical interactions between the nanopore fixed charges and the mobile charges confined in the reduced volume of the inside solution.},

The chemical species on the two outer sides of the membrane have charges of opposite sign and can be either surface-confined species (i.e., surface charges) or polyelectrolyte brushes. The advantage of this design over other types of rectifying nanopores is that it requires controlling the composition of the outer walls of the pore (which are easy to access) rather than the inner walls, thus simplifying the fabrication process. Ion-current rectification in nanopores with charged outer walls is ascribed to applied-potential-induced changes in the ionic concentration within the pore. The rectification efficiency is studied as a function of pore length, radius, surface charge and bulk electrolyte concentration. An analytical model is derived for the case of surface-confined charges that predicts the current-potential curves in very good agreement with the numerical calculations. Neutral nanopores with polyelectrolyte-modified outer walls have two distinct advantages compared to surface-charged systems: (i) they exhibit higher rectification factors due to the large charge density immobilized by the polyelectrolyte brushes, and (ii) the applied potential deforms the polyelectrolyte chains toward the oppositely charged electrode. This deformation brings the polyelectrolyte brushes into the pore in the low conductivity state and expels them from the pore in the high conductivity regime. Calculations of the potentials of mean-force suggest that the applied-field-induced conformational changes can be used to control the translocation of cargoes larger than ions, such as proteins and nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Nanopore analysis is an emerging technique that involves using a voltage to drive molecules through a nanoscale pore in a membrane between two electrolytes, and monitoring how the ionic current through the nanopore changes as single molecules pass through it. This approach allows charged polymers (including single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA and RNA) to be analysed with subnanometre resolution and without the need for labels or amplification. Recent advances suggest that nanopore-based sensors could be competitive with other third-generation DNA sequencing technologies, and may be able to rapidly and reliably sequence the human genome for under {\$}1,000. In this article we review the use of nanopore technology in DNA sequencing, genetics and medical diagnostics.},

abstract = {The conformational and thermodynamic behavior of chain molecules tethered to a planar surface are studied for a variety of solvent qualities with a recently developed single- chain mean-field theory. The lateral pressure isotherms calculated from the theory for chains of n=50 segments show very good quantitative agreement with the recent molecular dynamics simulations of Grest, without the use of any adjustable parameter, for good and Theta solvents. The behavior of the pressure isotherms is analyzed in terms of a virial expansion and it is shown that the regimes where there is scaling of the pressure with surface coverage a are very narrow for this chain length. Moreover, comparisons with analytical self-consistent field (SCF) theory show good agreement only when the parabolic density profile is used in the full virial equation. In the bad solvent regime the pressure isotherms for grafted chains show negative values of the pressure and also a negative compressibility for some range of surface coverages for temperatures below the Theta temperature. This indicates the possibility of microphase separation in this regime of temperature and surface coverages. For chains with translational degrees of freedom there is a first-order phase separation at temperatures below the Theta temperature into a very dilute and more concentrated polymer phase. From results of two different chain lengths it seems that there is a universal coexistence phase diagram in the scaling variables n(0.5)(T/Theta-1) vs n sigma. In the bad solvent regime it is found that the chains are highly collapsed for very low surface coverage. As the surface coverage is increased the chains tend to stretch laterally in order to gain as much contact as possible with the other polymer chains. This is in contrast to the good solvent regime where the chains always stretch perpendicular to the surface in order to avoid as much contact as possible with the other polymer chains. In the intermediate surface coverage regime it is found that the density profiles look parabolic-like for good solvents becoming more steplike as the quality of the solvent becomes poorer, in agreement with recent neutron scattering experiments. For very high surface coverages the density profiles in the good solvent regime also look steplike.},

@article{Nap2014e,
abstract = {This work addresses the effect of the Born self-energy contribution in the modeling of the structural and thermodynamical properties of weak polyelectrolytes confined to planar and curved surfaces. The theoretical framework is based on a theory that explicitly includes the conformations, size, shape, and charge distribution of all molecular species and considers the acid-base equilibrium of the weak polyelectrolyte. Namely, the degree of charge in the polymers is not imposed but it is a local varying property that results from the minimization of the total free energy. Inclusion of the dielectric properties of the polyelectrolyte is important as the environment of a polymer layer is very different from that in the adjacent aqueous solution. The main effect of the Born energy contribution on the molecular organization of an end-grafted weak polyacid layer is uncharging the weak acid (or basic) groups and consequently decreasing the concentration of mobile ions within the layer. The magnitude of the effect increases with polymer density and, in the case of the average degree of charge, it is qualitatively equivalent to a small shift in the equilibrium constant for the acid-base equilibrium of the weak polyelectrolyte monomers. The degree of charge is established by the competition between electrostatic interactions, the polymer conformational entropy, the excluded volume interactions, the translational entropy of the counterions and the acid-base chemical equilibrium. Consideration of the Born energy introduces an additional energetic penalty to the presence of charged groups in the polyelectrolyte layer, whose effect is mitigated by down-regulating the amount of charge, i.e., by shifting the local-acid base equilibrium towards its uncharged state. Shifting of the local acid-base equilibrium and its effect on the properties of the polyelectrolyte layer, without considering the Born energy, have been theoretically predicted previously. Account of the Born energy leads to systematic, but in general small, corrections to earlier theoretical predictions describing the behavior of weak polyelectrolyte layers. However, polyelectrolyte uncharging results in a decrease in the concentration of counterions and inclusion of the Born Energy can result in a substantial decrease of the counterion concentration. The effect of considering the Born energy contribution is explored for end-grafted weak polyelectrolyte layers by calculating experimental observables which are known to depend on the presence of charges within the polyelectrolyte layer: inclusion of the Born energy contribution leads to a decrease in the capacitance of polyelectrolyte-modified electrodes, a decrease of conductivity of polyelectrolyte-modified nanopores and an increase in the repulsion exerted by a planar polyelectrolyte layer confined by an opposing wall.},

Importantly, a number of computational and experimental studies have suggested that gated baskets ought to unfold their gates at the rim for permitting the passage of guests to/from their inner space. These dynamic hosts are therefore offered as useful models for investigating the process of gating in artificial systems. Furthermore, gated baskets should permit examining the benefit of controlling the rate by which reactants access a gated catalyst for promoting chemical reactions occurring in its confined space.},

abstract = {When organic materials are placed in environments which physically confine the materials at the nanometre scale, interfacial effects and confinement-induced loss of entropy can significantly alter materials' properties such as the glass transition temperature as well as the nanoscale morphology as compared to a "free" system. In block copolymers, nanoconfinement leads to a range of unusual self-organized nanoscale morphologies. In this article, attempts to induce nanoconfinement effects in new polymer systems as well as at interfaces will be highlighted and some possible future implications for organic synthesis and biology will be discussed.},

abstract = {Chemical modification of nanopore surfaces is of great interest as it means that the surface composition is no longer fixed by the choice of substrate material, even to the point where large biomolecules can be attached to the pore walls. Controlling nanopore transport characteristics is one important application of surface modification which is very relevant given the significant interest in sensors based on the transport of ions and molecules through nanopores. Reported here is a method to change the surface charge polarity of single track-etched conical nanopores in polyimide, which also has the potential to attach more complex molecules to the carboxyl groups on the nanopore walls. These carboxyl groups were converted into terminal amino groups, first by activation with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) followed by the covalent coupling of ethylenediamine. This results in a changed surface charge polarity. Regeneration of a carboxyl-terminated surface was also possible, by reaction of the amino groups with succinic anhydride. The success of these reactions was confirmed by measurements of the pore's pH sensitive current-voltage (I-V) characteristics before and after the chemical modification, which depend on surface charge. The permselectivity of the pores also changed accordingly with the modification.},

In this Article, we theoretically investigate the effects of size reduction, applied bias, and solution ionic strength in such devices. We compare the numerical solutions of the Poisson, Nernst-Planck (PNP), and Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with their one-dimensional, analytical approximations. We demonstrate that the contribution of electroosmosis is insignificant and find analytical approximations to PNP for bipolar and unipolar diodes that are in good agreement with numerical 3D solutions. We identify the minimal dimensions for such diodes that demonstrate ion current rectification behavior and demonstrate the importance of the edge effect in very short diodes.},

abstract = {From a physical perspective, nanofluidics represents an extremely rich domain. It hosts many mechanisms acting on the nanoscale, which combine together or interact with the confinement to generate new phenomena. Superfast flows in carbon nanotubes, nonlinear electrokinetic transport, slippage over smooth surfaces, nanobubble stability, etc. are the most striking phenomena that have been unveiled over the past few years, and some of them are still awaiting an explanation. One may anticipate that new nanofluidic effects will be discovered in the future, but at the moment, the technological barrier is high. Fabrication of nanochannels is most often a tour de force, slow and costly. However, with the accumulation of technological skills along with the use of new nanofluidic materials (like nanotubes), nanofluidics is becoming increasingly accessible to experimentalists. Among the technological challenges faced by the field, fabricating devices mimicking natural nanometric systems, such as aquaporins, ionic pumps or kidney osmotic filtering, seems the most demanding in terms of groundbreaking ideas. Nanoflow characterization remains delicate, although considerable progress has been achieved over the past years. The targeted application of nanofluidics is not only in the field of genomics and membrane science--with disruptive developments to be expected for water purification, desalination, and energy harvesting--but also for oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs. Today, in view of the markets that are targeted, nanofluidics may well impact the industry more than microfluidics; this would represent an unexpected paradox. These successes rely on using a variety of materials and technologies, using state-of-the-art nanofabrication, or low-tech inexpensive approaches. As a whole, nanofluidics is a fascinating field that is facing considerable challenges today. It possesses a formidable potential and offers much space for creative groundbreaking ideas.},

abstract = {The electrokinetic ionic-current rectification in a conical nanopore with linearly varying surface-charge distributions is studied theoretically by using a continuum model composed of a coupled system of the Nernst-Planck equations for the ionic-concentration field and the Poisson equation for the electric potential in the electrolyte solution. The numerical analysis includes the electrochemistry inside reservoirs connected to the nanopore, neglected in previous studies, and more precise accounts of the ionic current are provided. The surface-charge distribution, especially near the tip of the nanopore, significantly affects the ionic enrichment and depletion, which, in turn, influence the resulting ionic current and the rectification. It is shown that non-uniform surface-charge distribution can reverse the direction, or sense, of the rectification. Further insights into the ionic-current rectification are provided by discussing the intriguing details of the electric potential and ionic-concentration fields, leading to the rectification. Rationale for future studies on ionic-current rectification, associated with other non-uniform surface-charge distributions and electroosmotic convection for example, is discussed.},

abstract = {Single molecules of DNA or RNA can be detected as they are driven through an alpha-hemolysin channel by an applied electric field. During translocation, nucleotides within the polynucleotide must pass through the channel pore in sequential, single-file order because the limiting diameter of the pore can accommodate only one strand of DNA or RNA at a time. Here we demonstrate that this nanopore behaves as a detector that can rapidly discriminate between pyrimidine and purine segments along an RNA molecule. Nanopore detection and characterization of single molecules represent a new method for directly reading information encoded in linear polymers, and are critical first steps toward direct sequencing of individual DNA and RNA molecules.},

abstract = {Nanofluidics has emerged recently in the footsteps of microfluidics, following the quest for scale reduction inherent to nanotechnologies. By definition, nanofluidics explores transport phenomena of fluids at nanometer scales. Why is the nanometer scale specific? What fluid properties are probed at nanometric scales? In other words, why does 'nanofluidics' deserve its own brand name? In this critical review, we will explore the vast manifold of length scales emerging for fluid behavior at the nanoscale, as well as the associated mechanisms and corresponding applications. We will in particular explore the interplay between bulk and interface phenomena. The limit of validity of the continuum approaches will be discussed, as well as the numerous surface induced effects occurring at these scales, from hydrodynamic slippage to the various electro-kinetic phenomena originating from the couplings between hydrodynamics and electrostatics. An enlightening analogy between ion transport in nanochannels and transport in doped semi-conductors will be discussed (156 references).},

Open channels let selected ions diffuse rapidly down electrical and concentration gradients, whereas ion pumps labour tirelessly to maintain the gradients by consuming energy to slowly move ions thermodynamically uphill. Because of the diametrically opposed tasks and the divergent speeds of channels and pumps, they have traditionally been viewed as completely different entities, as alike as chalk and cheese. But new structural and mechanistic information about both of these classes of molecular machines challenges this comfortable separation and forces its re-evaluation.},

abstract = {The creation of synthetic devices that mimic functionality of biological systems is a task of fundamental importance for the future development of bio- and nanotechnology and also an ultimate test of our understanding of the biological systems. Among a plethora of bio-inspired devices, designed nanopores and nanochannels with an embedded functionality are of particular interest because of their potential applications in nanofluidic electronics, biosensing, separation, synthetic biology, and single-molecule manipulation. In this respect, nanopores with built-in stimulus-responsive properties are of special benefit. A transmembrane potential is a particularly useful stimulus as it is non-invasive, tunable, and can act over a short time scale. This critical review considers engineered solid-state and protein nanopores with voltage-responsive properties. The engineered systems show nonlinear current-voltage curves, and/or voltage-dependent switching between discrete conductance states (141 references).},

In this bi-channel system, the construction routes of the two asymmetric conical nanochannels provide a way to efficiently transform the nanodevice into four different functional working modes. In addition, the variation of external pH conditions leads the nanodevice to the uncharged, semi-charged and charged states, where the multistory ionic regulating function property is enhanced by the charged degree. This intelligent integration of the single functional nanochannels demonstrates a promising future for building more functional multi-channel integrated nanodevices as well as expands the functionalities of the bio-inspired smart nanochannels.},

abstract = {Using a simple model, it is shown that the cost of constraining a hydrated potassium ion inside a narrow pore is smaller than the cost of constraining hydrated sodium or lithium ions in pores of radius around 1.5 A. The opposite is true for pores of radius around 2.5 A. The reason for the selectivity in the first region is that the potassium ion allows for a greater distortion of its hydration shell and can therefore maintain a better coordination, and the reason for the reverse selectivity in the second region is that the smaller ions retain their hydration shells in these pores. This is relevant to the molecular basis of ion selective channels, and since this mechanism does not depend on the molecular details of the pore, it could also operate in all sorts of nanotubes.},

abstract = {To probe protonation dynamics inside the fully open alpha-toxin ion channel, we measured the pH-dependent fluctuations in its current. In the presence of 1 M NaCl dissolved in H2O and positive applied potentials (from the side of protein addition), the low frequency noise exhibited a single well defined peak between pH 4.5 and 7.5. A simple model in which the current is assumed to change by equal amounts upon the reversible protonation of each of N identical ionizable residues inside the channel describes the data well. These results, and the frequency dependence of the spectral density at higher frequencies, allow us to evaluate the effective pK = 5.5, as well as the rate constants for the reversible protonation reactions: kon = 8 x 10(9) M-1 s-1 and koff = 2.5 x 10(4) s-1. The estimate of kon is only slightly less than the diffusion-limited values measured by others for protonation reactions for free carboxyl or imidazole residues. Substitution of H2O by D2O caused a 3.8-fold decrease in the dissociation rate constant and shifted the pK to 6.0. The decrease in the ionization rate constants caused by H2O/D2O substitution permitted the reliable measurement of the characteristic relaxation time over a wide range of D+ concentrations and voltages. The dependence of the relaxation time on D+ concentration strongly supports the first order reaction model. The voltage dependence of the low frequency spectral density suggests that the protonation dynamics are virtually insensitive to the applied potential while the rate-limiting barriers for NaCl transport are voltage dependent. The number of ionizable residues deduced from experiments in H2O (N = 4.2) and D2O (N = 4.1) is in good agreement.},

abstract = {Ion channels are protein pores that span cell membranes and open and close in response to stimuli like changes in the transmembrane potential, binding of a ligand, or mechanical stress. When open, ions pass through the pore, and hence across the cell membrane, and when closed, ion-transport is precluded. Hence, these channels are nanodevices that have a current-rectification function. There is intense research effort aimed at understanding the molecular-level mechanism for this function. One approach for elucidating the mechanism is to construct a simple abiotic system that mimics this function and to use the mechanistic details of this mimic as a guide to understand the more complex biological channel. We describe here such an abiotic mimic: a synthetic membrane that contains a single conical gold nanotube. The advantage of this mimic is that the surface charge and chemistry of the nanotube wall can be varied, at will, by judicious choice of electrolyte or by thiol chemisorption. This has allowed us to make conical Au nanotubes that rectify the ion current and, just as importantly, to definitively elucidate the mechanism of this function.},

abstract = {We report a nanofluidic transistor based on a metal-oxide-solution (MOSol) system that is similar to a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Using a combination of fluorescence and electrical measurements, we demonstrate that gate voltage modulates the concentration of ions and molecules in the channel and controls the ionic conductance. Our results illustrate the efficacy of field-effect control in nanofluidics, which could have broad implications on integrated nanofluidic circuits for manipulation of ions and biomolecules in sub-femtoliter volumes.},

abstract = {Electrophoresis, the motion of charged species through liquids and pores under the influence of an external electric field, has been the principle source of chemical pumping for numerous micro- and nanofluidic device platforms. Recent measurements of ion currents through single or few carbon nanotube channels have yielded values of ion mobility that range from close to the bulk mobility to values that are two to seven orders of magnitude higher than the bulk mobility. However, these experiments cannot directly measure ion flux. Experiments on membranes that contain a large number of nanotube pores allow the ion current and ion flux to be measured independently. Here, we report that the mobilities of ions within such membranes are approximately three times higher than the bulk mobility. Moreover, the induced electro-osmotic velocities are four orders of magnitude faster than those measured in conventional porous materials. We also show that a nanotube membrane can function as a rectifying diode due to ionic steric effects within the nanotubes.},

abstract = {Biological protein channels have many remarkable properties such as gating, high permeability, and selectivity, which have motivated researchers to mimic their functions for practical applications. Herein, using molecular dynamics simulations, we design bioinspired nanopores in graphene sheets that can discriminate between Na(+) and K(+), two ions with very similar properties. The simulation results show that, under transmembrane voltage bias, a nanopore containing four carbonyl groups to mimic the selectivity filter of the KcsA K(+) channel preferentially conducts K(+) over Na(+). A nanopore functionalized by four negatively charged carboxylate groups to mimic the selectivity filter of the NavAb Na(+) channel selectively binds Na(+) but transports K(+) over Na(+). Surprisingly, the ion selectivity of the smaller diameter pore containing three carboxylate groups can be tuned by changing the magnitude of the applied voltage bias. Under lower voltage bias, it transports ions in a single-file manner and exhibits Na(+) selectivity, dictated by the knock-on ion conduction and selective blockage by Na(+). Under higher voltage bias, the nanopore is K(+)-selective, as the blockage by Na(+) is destabilized and the stronger affinity for carboxylate groups slows the passage of Na(+) compared with K(+). The computational design of biomimetic ion-selective nanopores helps to understand the mechanisms of selectivity in biological ion channels and may also lead to a wide range of potential applications such as sensitive ion sensors, nanofiltration membranes for Na(+)/K(+) separation, and voltage-tunable nanofluidic devices.},

abstract = {Nature provides a huge range of biological materials, just as ion channels, with various smart functions over millions of years of evolution, and which serve as a big source of bio-inspiration for biomimetic materials. In this critical review, a strategy for the design and synthesis of biomimetic smart nanopores and nanochannels is presented and put into context with recent progress in this rapidly growing field from biological, inorganic, organic to composite nanopore and nanochannel materials, which can respond to single/multiple external stimuli, e.g., pH, temperature, light, and so on. This review is intended to utilize a specific responsive behavior for regulating ionic transport properties inside the single nanopore or nanochannel as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the design strategy, and provide an overview of this fascinating research field (109 references).},

@article{Brunsen2012,
abstract = {Rational construction of interfaces based on multicomponent responsive systems in which molecular transport is mediated by structures of nanoscale dimensions has become a very fertile research area in biomimetic supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we describe the creation of hybrid mesostructured interfaces with reversible gate-like transport properties that can be controlled by chemical inputs, such as protons or calcium ions. This was accomplished by taking advantage of the surface-initiated polymerization of 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphate (MEP) monomer units into and onto mesoporous silica thin films. In this way, phosphate-bearing polymer brushes were used as "gatekeepers" located not only on the outer surface of mesoporous thin films but also in the inner environment of the porous scaffold. Pore-confined PMEP brushes respond to the external triggering chemical signals not only by altering their physicochemical properties but also by switching the transport properties of the mesoporous film. The ion-gate response/operation was based on the protonation and/or chelation of phosphate monomer units in which the polymer brush works as an off-on switch in response to the presence of protons or Ca(2+) ions. The hybrid meso-architectured interface and their functional features were studied by a combination of experimental techniques including ellipso-porosimetry, cyclic voltammetry, X-ray reflectivity, grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in situ atomic force microscopy. In this context, we believe that the integration of stimuli-responsive polymer brushes into nanoscopic supramolecular architectures would provide new routes toward multifunctional biomimetic nanosystems displaying transport properties similar to those encountered in biological ligand-gated ion channels.},
